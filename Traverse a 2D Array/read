Traverse a 2D Array- Editorial
Difficulty: Low
Prerequisite: 2-D Arrays,Implementation
Problem Statement:
Given a matrix with n rows and m columns. Print the matrix elements for each column from the bottom of the row to the top, print all the elements in a single line.Look at the image for better understandinghere

Hint:
None.

Short Explaination
In this question, we are given a 2-D array, with dimensions nxm,and we have to print the matrix from bottom to top for each column moving in left to right direction.

Detailed Explanation:
In this question, we are given a 2D array, of dimension nxm, and we have to print the matrix in the way mentioned

4 3
1 8 9
2 7 10
3 6 11
4 5 12

Output: 4 3 2 1 5 6 7 8 12 11 10 9
To simplify the problem, a matrix can be considered to be broken down into arrays, where each array will contain elements of each column moving left to right and then we print the array elements in reverse order to get the original order of bottom to top printing manner for each column or we can simply start printing from bottom (i = n-1) of the row to the top (i = 0) for each column

Pseudo Code

- int n //number of rows
- int m //number of columns
- int[][] arr //input matrix
- for (int i=0;i<m;i++) // going left to right
  _ for (int j = n-1; j>=0; j--) // going bottom to top for each column
  _ print arr[j][i] // printing the matrix element
  Time Complexity:
  Since all the elements in the matrix need to be traversed, therefore, the time comlexity will be O(n \* m)

Space Complexity:
No extra space is required, hence the space complexity will be O(1).

Alternate Solution:
None.
